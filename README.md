## Overview

This library is a strict implementation of the [OBO flat file format 1.4](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html)
syntax using the [`pest`](https://pest.rs/) parser generator. It was outsourced from [`fastobo`](https://github.com/althonos/fastobo/)
to reduce compilation time, since deriving the `OboParser` from
[`grammar.pest`](https://github.com/althonos/fastobo/blob/master/fastobo-syntax/src/grammar.pest) takes some time.

The parser itself is reexported in [`fastobo::parser`](https://docs.rs/fastobo/latest/fastobo/parser/), so there
is probably no need to depend on this library directly.


## Strictness

The syntax is a strict implementation of the 1.4 format, with the following exceptions:

* `property_value` clauses can have a value with is not quote-enclosed. This is a workaround
  to support some ontology files using `obo2owl` or the `owlapi` to generate their OBO
  counterpart, which does not quote-enclose property values
  ([owlcs/owlapi#833](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/pull/833)).
* ISO-8601 datetimes can only be parsed from the canonical format (`á»²YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`)
  with an optional timezone. Week dates and calendar dates are not supported.
